# MITRE Att\&CK: Azure Security Control Mapping

## Overview:

The Azure Stack Control Mapping for MITRE is a framework developed by Microsoft that links Azure's security controls and features to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. MITRE ATT\&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a widely used knowledge base that categorizes and describes the tactics and techniques adversaries use during cyberattacks.

### Control Mapping Purpose

### Alignment

It aligns Azure's native security capabilities—such as identity and access management, network security, logging and monitoring, and data protection—to specific tactics and techniques identified in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. This alignment helps organizations understand how Azure can be used to defend against various types of cyber threats.

### Guidance

It provides guidance to security teams on how to configure, monitor, and utilize Azure services effectively to detect, prevent, and respond to threats associated with each MITRE ATT\&CK technique. This guidance assists in implementing security best practices within Azure environments.

### **Risk Management**:&#x20;

By mapping Azure controls to MITRE techniques, organizations can assess their security posture more comprehensively. They can identify gaps in coverage, prioritize security investments, and improve incident response planning based on the specific threats they may face.

### **Integration**

It facilitates integration with existing threat detection and response workflows, allowing security teams to develop detection rules, perform threat hunting, and conduct incident response activities that are informed by both Azure-specific capabilities and MITRE's threat intelligence.



The Azure Stack Control Mapping for MITRE enhances cybersecurity operations within Azure by providing a structured approach to understanding, implementing, and improving defenses against cyber threats based on industry-standard tactics and techniques. It enables organizations to leverage Azure's cloud-native security features more effectively to protect their data, applications, and infrastructure.
