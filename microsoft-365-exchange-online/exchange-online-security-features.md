# Exchange Online: Security Features

Email is a critical communication tool for organizations, often storing valuable data. To ensure proper use, organizations should establish messaging policies that govern usage, outline user behavior, and address any restricted communication types. Policies should also manage the email lifecycle, ensure retention for legal and regulatory reasons, and preserve emails for litigation and eDiscovery.

Sensitive information, such as intellectual property and personal data, must be safeguarded to prevent leaks.
