Prioritizing the examination and scoring of the activities of these users can help alert you to potential risks that may have higher consequences for your organization. Use the **Priority user groups** setting to define the users in your organization that need closer inspection and more sensitive risk scoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Priority physical assets (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/insider-risk-management-settings-priority-physical-assets) | Identifying access to priority physical assets and correlating access activity to user events is an important component of your compliance infrastructure. These physical assets represent priority locations in your organization, such as company buildings, data centers, or server rooms. Insider risk activities may be associated with users working unusual hours, attempting to access these unauthorized sensitive or secure areas, and requests for access to high-level areas without legitimate needs.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You can:<br>- Send a notification email when the first alert is generated for a new policy<br>- Send a daily email when new high-severity alerts are generated<br>- Send a weekly email summarizing policies that have unresolved warnings</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Inline alert customization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/insider-risk-management-settings-inline-alert-customization)       | Inline alert customization allows you to quickly tune an insider risk management policy directly from the **Alerts dashboard** while reviewing the alert. Alerts are generated when a risk management activity meets the thresholds configured in the related policy. To reduce the number of alerts you get from this type of activity, you can change the thresholds or remove the risk management activity from the policy altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
