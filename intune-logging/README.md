# Intune Logging

## Overview

Microsoft Intune provides robust logging capabilities for monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting device management activities. Key logs include Audit Logs (tracking policy changes and actions), Operational Logs (device enrollment and compliance data), and Device Diagnostics (troubleshooting logs collected remotely). Logs can be integrated with Azure Monitor for advanced analytics, long-term storage, and SIEM integration. Windows devices also generate Intune Management Extension Logs for script execution and application deployment. Administrators can set up custom alerts and monitoring to detect anomalies and ensure compliance.
