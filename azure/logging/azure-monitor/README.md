# Azure Monitor

## Azure Monitor for Threat Hunting

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring service provided by Microsoft Azure that offers a unified solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It enables threat hunters to proactively search for and identify threats within an Azure environment, leveraging advanced data analytics, customizable visualizations, and automated responses to enhance security operations.

### Key Features of Azure Monitor for Threat Hunting

1. **Data Collection**: Collect telemetry from Azure resources, on-premises environments, and custom sources, including logs, metrics, and activity data.
2. **Log Analytics**: Utilize Azure Log Analytics to query and analyze vast amounts of log data using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
3. **Security Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel for advanced threat detection and incident response.
4. **Alerts**: Set up sophisticated alerting mechanisms to notify you of suspicious activities and potential threats.
5. **Dashboards and Workbooks**: Create customizable and interactive dashboards and workbooks to visualize and drill down into security data.
6. **Automation**: Automate threat response actions using Azure Automation and Logic Apps.

### How Azure Monitor Supports Threat Hunting

**Data Collection and Integration**

Azure Monitor consolidates data from a variety of sources, providing a comprehensive view of your security environment:

* **Azure Activity Logs**: Capture all control-plane actions, providing a detailed record of management operations.
* **Resource Logs**: Collect logs from Azure resources such as virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts to monitor operational and security events.
* **Azure Security Center**: Integrate with Azure Security Center to gain insights into vulnerabilities and threat intelligence.
* **Azure Sentinel**: Leverage Azure Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution, for enhanced threat detection, investigation, and response.

**Log Analytics for Threat Hunting**

Log Analytics in Azure Monitor allows threat hunters to perform complex queries on collected log data. By using KQL, threat hunters can identify anomalies, investigate incidents, and uncover potential threats.

*   **Example Query**: Detect unusual login attempts:

    ```kusto
    kustoCopy codeSecurityEvent
    | where EventID == 4625
    | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), Account
    | order by count_ desc
    ```

**Alerts and Notifications**

Set up alerts to be notified of suspicious activities, enabling prompt investigation and response:

* **Create Alert Rules**: Define specific conditions for alerts, such as multiple failed login attempts from a single IP address within a short timeframe.
* **Action Groups**: Configure action groups to determine the response actions when an alert is triggered, such as sending an email, creating an incident in Azure Sentinel, or executing an automated response.

**Dashboards and Workbooks**

Visualize and analyze security data using customizable dashboards and workbooks:

* **Dashboards**: Provide an overview of key security metrics and alert statuses, helping you quickly identify areas of concern.
* **Workbooks**: Use workbooks to create detailed, interactive reports that allow you to drill down into specific data points and conduct in-depth investigations.
  * **Example Workbook**: Threat Hunting for Suspicious Login Activity:
    *   **Failed Logins Query**:

        ```kusto
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625
        | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), Account, IPAddress
        ```
    *   **Successful Logins Query**:

        ```kusto
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4624
        | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), Account, IPAddress
        ```
    * **Visualizations**: Use time charts, bar charts, and tables to display the data and identify patterns or anomalies.

**Automation**

Automate threat response actions to improve efficiency and reduce response time:

* **Logic Apps**: Create workflows to automatically respond to detected threats, such as blocking IP addresses or isolating compromised resources.
* **Azure Automation**: Use runbooks to automate routine tasks and incident response procedures, ensuring consistent and timely actions.
