# Policy

### Policy Overview:

This category contains records of all effect action operations performed by [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview). Examples of the types of events you would see in this category include _Audit_ and _Deny_. Every action taken by Policy is modeled as an operation on a resource.

### Schema:

| Element Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| authorization                | Array of Azure RBAC properties of the event. For new resources, this is the action and scope of the request that triggered evaluation. For existing resources, the action is "Microsoft.Resources/checkPolicyCompliance/read".                                                                                                       |
| caller                       | For new resources, the identity that initiated a deployment.

| channels                     | Policy events use only the "Operation" channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| correlationId                | Usually a GUID in the string format.

| level                        | [Severity level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema#severity-level) of the event. Audit uses "Warning" and Deny uses "Error". An auditIfNotExists or deployIfNotExists error can generate "Warning" or "Error" depending on severity. All other Policy events use "Informational". |
| operationId                  | A GUID shared among the events that correspond to a single operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
