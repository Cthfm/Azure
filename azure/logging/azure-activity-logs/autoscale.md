# Autoscale

## Autoscale Overview:

The Autoscale category in the Azure Activity Log records events related to the operation of the autoscale engine based on your defined settings. This includes actions like scaling up or down instances automatically based on time or load metrics. Events such as "Autoscale scale up action failed" are logged here, capturing both successful and failed scaling actions.
