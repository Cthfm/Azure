# PowerShell for Azure

For threat hunters navigating Azure environments, PowerShell stands as a potent tool for automating and streamlining security operations. Integrated with the Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, PowerShell empowers analysts to efficiently query, manage, and investigate Azure resources programmatically. The Graph API facilitates seamless interaction with Microsoft 365 data, enabling deep insights into user activities, permissions, and security events across cloud services. Concurrently, the Azure Resource Manager API provides direct access to Azure infrastructure, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and response actions. Harnessing PowerShell alongside these APIs equips threat hunters with the capability to perform advanced queries, automate incident response workflows, and enhance overall threat detection efforts within Azure environments.
