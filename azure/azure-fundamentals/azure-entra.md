Azure Entra is a suite of identity and access capabilities provided by Microsoft to help organizations secure access, manage identities, and ensure compliance across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Here are the primary services within Azure Entra:

## Overview of Services:

### 1. **Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**

Azure Entra ID is the foundational identity and access management service within Azure. It provides comprehensive capabilities for managing user identities and securing access to applications both in the cloud and on-premises. Key functionalities include:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users can access multiple applications with a single identity.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds a layer of security by requiring two or more verification methods.
* **Conditional Access**: Allows organizations to implement automated access control decisions based on conditions.
* **Identity Protection**: Uses machine learning to detect anomalies and potential identity threats.

* **Centralized Visibility and Insights**: Provides a unified view of permissions across Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform, allowing organizations to see who has access to what resources and how those permissions are utilized.
* **Risk Assessment and Remediation**: Identifies, prioritizes, and mitigates risky permissions by offering automated workflows to enforce least privilege access, reducing potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance and Reporting**: Delivers comprehensive reporting and auditing capabilities to support compliance requirements, helping organizations demonstrate adherence to security policies and regulations.

### 3. **Azure Entra Verified ID**

Azure Entra Verified ID is a decentralized identity service that empowers individuals to control their digital identities using verifiable credentials. This service aligns with the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and can be used for scenarios like:
