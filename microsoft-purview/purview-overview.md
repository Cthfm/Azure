# Purview Overview

## Purview Overview

Microsoft Purview is a comprehensive set of data governance, risk, and compliance solutions designed to help organizations manage, govern, and protect their data across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments. It integrates various Microsoft services under a single platform, enabling enterprises to maintain compliance, safeguard data, and ensure data transparency.

### Key Components of Microsoft Purview:

1. **Data Governance**:
   * **Purview Data Map**: Helps organizations automatically discover, classify, and manage their data assets. The data map scans data sources, categorizes sensitive information, and maintains up-to-date metadata on your data landscape.
   * **Data Catalog**: Allows users to search, understand, and govern data. With the catalog, you can easily see how data flows through systems, who owns the data, and how it's classified.
2. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Purview includes DLP tools to monitor and control sensitive data. These tools help enforce policies that prevent data leaks, including email content, document sharing, and file storage.
3. **Information Protection**:
   * **Sensitivity Labels**: Allows organizations to classify and protect sensitive data. Labels can be applied manually by users or automatically based on policies. It integrates with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to protect files.
   * **Encryption and Access Control**: Microsoft Purview works in tandem with Azure Information Protection to enforce encryption policies and control who can access data.
4. **Compliance Management**:
   * **Compliance Manager**: Provides real-time risk assessments, helping organizations manage their compliance posture. It helps with managing data privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA and offers insights into compliance gaps.
   * **Regulatory Record Keeping**: Maintains an audit trail and provides advanced eDiscovery tools to search and export data for legal or regulatory purposes.
5. **Data Lifecycle Management**:
   * **Retention Labels**: Ensures sensitive data is retained or deleted according to organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
6. **Insider Risk Management**: Detects and mitigates potential insider threats, such as data leaks or policy violations, by analyzing user activity and behavior across your organizationâ€™s data estate.
7. **eDiscovery**:
   * **Advanced eDiscovery**: Facilitates legal discovery of electronic information. This feature can identify, hold, and export relevant data for legal cases, investigations, or audits.
8. **Communication Compliance**: This feature enables monitoring of communication channels (e.g., Teams, email) to detect violations like harassment, sensitive data sharing, or inappropriate behavior, ensuring adherence to communication policies.
