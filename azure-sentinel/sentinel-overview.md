# Sentinel Overview

Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution offered by Microsoft. It provides intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise by leveraging AI and automation to detect, investigate, and respond to threats in real time. As a scalable and flexible solution, it integrates seamlessly with various data sources, including Microsoft products like Azure, Office 365, and third-party services, to provide a unified view of security events.

With Azure Sentinel, hunters can collect, correlate, and analyze data from their entire IT environment to identify suspicious activities and potential attacks. Its advanced hunting capabilities allow security teams to perform proactive threat investigations using the built-in query language, Kusto Query Language (KQL). Sentinel also supports automated responses through playbooks and workflows, helping to streamline incident response and reduce the manual effort required. By integrating with Microsoft's security ecosystem, Azure Sentinel delivers powerful insights, making it easier for security teams to manage and mitigate threats efficiently.
