# Defense Strategies

## **Defensive Strategies Against Execution in Azure Environments**

In Azure, defending against Execution means **restricting what code can be run**, **who can deploy workloads**, **securing serverless and container platforms**, and **monitoring cloud-native command execution** at scale.

You want to **trap, restrict, and catch** any adversary trying to go active.

### 🧑‍💻 Cloud Administration Command (T1651)

| Defensive Action                                                                                                                 | Why It Matters                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Apply strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure — only admins can deploy resources or run scripts                      | Least privilege reduces risk of abuse                |
| 📜 Require Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for admin roles with Just-in-Time (JIT) activation                               | Attackers can't live on privileged roles permanently |
| 🛡️ Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud to detect risky operations (e.g., VM extensions, script execution)                       | Alerts when common execution paths are abused        |
| 🚫 Apply Azure Policy to deny creation of high-risk extensions (CustomScript, RunCommand) unless necessary                       | Block mass deployment of RCE scripts via extensions  |
| 🔍 Monitor Resource Manager (ARM) activity logs for deployment operations (`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/write`) | Real-time execution tracking                         |

✅ **Effect**: Restricts who can perform cloud-native administrative execution.

### 🖥️ Command and Scripting Interpreter → Cloud API

| Defensive Action                                                                                                            | Why It Matters                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 📜 Use Azure Policy to enforce allowed resource types (e.g., only specific container types, no arbitrary resource creation) | Attackers can't deploy new infrastructure easily       |
| 🛡️ Enable Defender for APIs and monitor all Azure API usage                                                                | Detect unauthorized API actions and anomalous behavior |
| 🔒 Apply Conditional Access for API access (e.g., require managed device)                                                   | Attackers can't abuse stolen tokens easily             |
| 🚫 Require signed API requests and service principal restrictions with minimum needed permissions                           | Reduce API abuse risk                                  |
| 🔍 Use Azure Monitor to detect anomalous API deployment patterns (mass deployments, unusual resource types)                 | Spot attacker API activity fast                        |

✅ **Effect**: Controls who can execute code via direct API interaction.

### 🛠️ Serverless Execution

| Defensive Action                                                                                                 | Why It Matters                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛡️ Apply Azure Policy to restrict serverless deployments to trusted resource groups                             | Attackers can't scatter functions everywhere            |
| 📜 Enforce CI/CD pipeline validations for Azure Functions — no direct function edits in production               | Blocks rogue code injection                             |
| 🔒 Require Azure AD Authentication on Azure Function endpoints                                                   | Stop unauthenticated function trigger abuse             |
| 🚫 Deploy Functions in VNET-integrated plans whenever possible                                                   | Private execution only — no public serverless endpoints |
| 🔍 Monitor App Service/Function App deployment events and trigger anomalies (new function, sudden traffic spike) | Detects rapid serverless-based C2 channels              |

✅ **Effect**: Makes serverless code execution safe, validated, and auditable.

### 👥 User Execution → Malicious Image

| Defensive Action                                                                                            | Why It Matters                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 📜 Enforce container image signing (e.g., Azure Container Registry + Cosign + Notary)                       | Only signed, trusted images can be deployed         |
| 🔒 Enable Microsoft Defender for Containers (Defender for AKS, ACR) for runtime image scanning              | Detect backdoors at rest and runtime                |
| 🚫 Restrict who can push to Azure Container Registry via RBAC                                               | Block attackers from uploading malicious containers |
| 🛡️ Use Kubernetes admission controllers (Gatekeeper, Kyverno) to validate image sources and configurations | Block unauthorized images before they run           |
| 🔍 Monitor ACR push logs and AKS deployment logs for unapproved images                                      | Detect compromised supply chains                    |

✅ **Effect**: Stops malicious container images from ever reaching execution in AKS, ACI, or App Services.

| Azure CLI/Portal/PowerShell abuse | Strict RBAC, PIM with JIT, Defender alerts on script execution                   |
| Cloud API exploitation            | Azure Policy resource controls, Defender for APIs, Conditional Access for APIs   |
| Serverless function execution     | Restrict serverless deployment scopes, CI/CD validation, authenticated functions |
| Malicious container images        | Enforce image signing, runtime scanning with Defender, admission controls on AKS |

## 🎯 Final Summary

Defending against Execution in Azure focuses on:

* **Locking down who can run or deploy anything** (RBAC + JIT + Policy)
* **Validating code before it runs** (CI/CD gates, signed images, serverless restrictions)
* **Detecting execution quickly at the control plane and runtime** (Defender, Azure Monitor, Sentinel)
* **Making serverless and container platforms resilient to abuse**
