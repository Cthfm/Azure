# IAAS Matrix

## Overview

The MITRE ATT\&CK framework is a knowledge base used to understand the actions and behaviors of adversaries in various environments. It helps security teams identify potential threats, assess risks, and improve security controls by mapping known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber adversaries.

The MITRE ATT\&CK for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) matrix is a subset of the broader ATT\&CK framework that focuses on adversary behavior in cloud environments specifically leveraging IaaS services. This matrix helps defenders understand and detect attacks that target cloud-based infrastructure, which includes services like virtual machines (VMs), networking, storage, and compute resources hosted by Microsoft Azure.

### Key Components of the IaaS Matrix:

* **Tactics**: These are the goals or objectives of the adversary (e.g., initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, etc.). Tactics are the columns in the matrix.
* **Techniques**: These represent the specific methods adversaries use to achieve their goals (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, etc.). Techniques are listed as rows in the matrix.
* **Sub-techniques**: More granular methods that fall under broader techniques. For example, under "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation," there may be sub-techniques specific to different vulnerabilities.

### Why It Matters:

1. **Cloud-Specific Threat Detection**: The IaaS matrix helps teams better understand and detect attacks specific to cloud infrastructure, which might otherwise be overlooked by traditional security approaches.
2. **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: By aligning your cloud security posture with the ATT\&CK framework, you can identify and prioritize areas that are vulnerable to attack.
3. **Cloud Security Best Practices**: The matrix provides insights into common attack patterns, helping organizations improve cloud security practices and prevent common mistakes.
