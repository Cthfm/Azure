# Defensive Strategies

## **Defensive Strategies Against Execution in Containerized Environments**

Once adversaries gain initial access, Execution techniques allow them to run commands, deploy malicious containers, or execute scripts inside your Kubernetes cluster. The goal of your defenses here is to prevent unauthorized code execution at runtime and restrict execution paths even if attackers get a toe-hold.

### 🧰 1. **Harden Container Runtime Controls**

| Action                                                                    | Why It Matters                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛡️ Enforce container security contexts (no privilege escalation)         | Prevent attackers from gaining extra runtime rights |
| 📜 Use AppArmor/SELinux/ seccomp profiles on pods                         | Restrict syscalls containers can execute            |
| 🚫 Block containers with `privileged: true` or host namespace access      | Stop easy host-level attacks                        |
| 📂 Use read-only root filesystems and drop unnecessary Linux capabilities | Make persistence harder                             |

✅ Enforced by **OPA Gatekeeper**, **Kyverno**, or PodSecurity Admission.

### 🐳 2. **Control Container Deployment Sources**

| Action                                                                   | Why It Matters                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 📜 Only allow images from trusted, signed registries (Cosign, Notary)    | Prevent pulling malicious containers               |
| 🚫 Block `kubectl run` or `kubectl create` in restricted namespaces      | No ad-hoc deployments by compromised users or pods |
| 📋 Enforce tight workload identity controls (Azure Workload Identity)    | Only trusted identities can deploy workloads       |
| 🧠 Scan container images for malware pre-deployment (Trivy, Clair, Aqua) | Block malicious images at CI/CD pipelines          |

✅ Defeats attackers who attempt to deploy backdoored or trojanized pods.

### 🔐 3. **Restrict Kubernetes Native Execution Paths**

| Action                                                            | Why It Matters                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Restrict `kubectl exec` usage to cluster admins only           | Block podshell access for compromised accounts                        |
| 📜 Monitor Kubernetes API server for exec events (`kubectl exec`) | Detect real-time container execution attempts                         |
| 🚫 Block or heavily restrict CronJobs/Jobs creation               | Prevent scheduled malicious execution via Kubernetes-native resources |

✅ Stops abuse of **kubectl exec**, **jobs**, **CronJobs**, or **pods** as execution vehicles.

### 🔥 4. **Detect Suspicious Execution in Real Time**

| Action                                                                               | Why It Matters                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📡 Deploy Falco to monitor container execution                                       | Catch reverse shells, suspicious binaries, or runtime injections |
| 🧠 Use anomaly detection to spot sudden spikes in process launches inside containers | Attackers tend to run unexpected commands                        |
| 📜 Log Kubernetes audit events for pod creation, exec, and new deployments           | Creates forensic trail of suspicious execution activities        |

✅ Visibility into execution helps detect and respond quickly if preventive controls fail.

### 🛡️ 5. **Limit Runtime Behavior**

| Action                                                         | Why It Matters                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📋 Enforce Network Policies                                    | Pods can only talk to what they need, blocks C2 channels        |
| 📜 Use PodDisruptionBudgets and resource quotas                | Limit blast radius of runaway pods and malicious Jobs           |
| 🛠️ Enable PodSecurity Standards (Baseline or Restricted mode) | Blocks most dangerous pod specs (privileged, host mounts, etc.) |

✅ Even if execution happens, it is sandboxed and contained.

| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubectl exec` abuse                     | Block exec, monitor API server, restrict RBAC permissions      |
| Malicious container deployment           | Enforce image signing, scan images, restrict `kubectl run`     |
| Scheduled Task/CronJob abuse             | Admission control to restrict CronJobs/Jobs creation           |
| Privileged container execution           | Enforce seccomp, AppArmor, restrict hostPath/hostNetwork       |
| Runtime code execution inside containers | Falco, anomaly detection on process trees and network behavior |

## 🎯 Final Summary

Defending against Execution focuses on:

* **Blocking dangerous pod specs** (before they run)
* **Restricting who can execute commands** (and how)
* **Detecting unauthorized execution quickly** (at runtime)
* **Containing any execution that does happen** (sandbox + network restrict)
