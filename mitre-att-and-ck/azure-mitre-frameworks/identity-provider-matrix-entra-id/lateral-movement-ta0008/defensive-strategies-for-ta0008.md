  * Use Azure Managed Identities for secure token management.
  * Restrict token scope to the minimum permissions required (Principle of Least Privilege).
* **Conditional Access**:
  * Implement policies to ensure that tokens are only issued to compliant devices and trusted locations.

* **Audit and Monitoring**:
  * Use Azure Monitor or Microsoft Sentinel to track unusual API calls or token activity via logs such as Azure Entra ID Sign-ins and Application logs.
