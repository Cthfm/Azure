# Basic vs Advanced Security Auditing

## **Overview**

**Basic vs. Advanced Security Auditing** in Windows refers to the granularity and control over which events are logged. Letâ€™s break down both types, their differences, and which Windows versions they apply to based on the official Microsoft documentation and other relevant insights.

### **1. Basic Security Auditing**

* **Scope:** High-level or general security events such as successful/failed logins, account changes, policy changes, etc.
* **Categories:** Basic auditing focuses on **broad actions** and **event categories**:
  * Account logon events (e.g., user login success/failure)
  * Logon/logoff events
  * Object access attempts (e.g., access to files, folders)
  * Policy change events
* **Use Case:**
  * Useful when monitoring overall system security with less detailed logging.
  * Easier to configure and generate fewer logs, which is helpful in environments that need to conserve storage or avoid overwhelming security teams.
* **Configuration:** Enabled through the Local Security Policy (GPO), under `Security Settings` > `Local Policies` > `Audit Policy`.
* **Windows Versions Supported:** Available on **Windows Server and client editions**, such as Windows 10/11, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, and later versions.

### **2. Advanced Security Auditing**

* **Scope:** Provides **more detailed control** over the types of events that are audited, allowing organizations to track specific activities.
* **Categories:** Introduced additional audit settings beyond basic ones, with granular **subcategories** such as:
  * **Process tracking:** Detailed events on process creation and termination.
  * **Logon events:** Extra details such as interactive vs. remote logins.
  * **Directory service access:** Deep insights into changes and queries in Active Directory.
  * **Detailed Object Access:** Logs fine-grained access control attempts on files or objects, including access control list (ACL) information.
* **Use Case:**
  * Recommended for **high-security environments** that require precise tracking, such as financial institutions or military setups.
  * Helps correlate **specific activities** (like a process injection attempt) with user actions or suspicious access patterns.
* **Configuration:** Available via **Advanced Audit Policy Configuration** in Group Policy:
  * Found under:\
    `Computer Configuration` > `Windows Settings` > `Security Settings` > `Advanced Audit Policy Configuration` > `Audit Policies`.
  * Allows enabling or disabling individual **subcategories** of audit events to avoid excess noise in logs.
* **Windows Versions Supported:** Advanced auditing applies to **Windows Server (2012 R2 and later)** and **client OSes (Windows 7/8/10/11)**. It provides more control compared to the basic audit policy settings available on older systems like **Windows XP** or **Server 2003**.

### **Comparison Chart: Basic vs. Advanced Auditing**

| **Feature**              | **Basic Auditing**          | **Advanced Security Auditing**                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Level of Granularity** | General categories          | Fine-tuned, per-event logging                 |
| **Control**              | Limited to broad actions    | Specific event subcategories                  |
| **Noise (Log Volume)**   | Lower (fewer events)        | Higher (more detailed logs)                   |
| **Use Case**             | General monitoring          | Detailed forensic tracking and threat hunting |
| **Configuration Method** | Local Policy > Audit Policy | GPO > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration     |
| **Supported Systems**    | Windows 7+, Server 2008+    | Windows 7+, Server 2012 R2+                   |

### Which Auditing Should I Use?

* **Basic Auditing** is useful when you need **quick, lightweight monitoring**.
* **Advanced Auditing** gives organizations **granular visibility** over system activities, making it ideal for environments with **specific compliance** or security needs.

Both auditing types can be applied to **Windows Server and client editions**, and the right choice depends on the need for granularity. For security teams focused on detailed incident response, **advanced auditing** offers better flexibility and control.
