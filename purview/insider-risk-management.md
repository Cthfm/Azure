# Insider Risk Management

### **What is Insider Risk Management?**

**Insider Risk Management (IRM)** in Microsoft Purview is a solution that:

> **Detects, investigates, and helps prevent risky activity inside your organization — before it becomes a serious security or compliance incident.**

Not all security risks come from hackers or external attackers.\
Often, **employees**, **contractors**, or **partners** — either **accidentally** or **intentionally** — can:

* Leak sensitive data
* Violate company policies
* Perform actions that put the organization at risk

**Microsoft Purview IRM** helps you **spot** and **respond** to these risks **early**.

### **Why Insider Risk Management Matters**

| Reason                       | Example                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prevent Data Leaks**       | An employee downloads sensitive files before resigning.                        |
| **Detect Policy Violations** | Someone shares confidential data with a competitor.                            |
| **Manage HR-related Risks**  | Employees flagged by HR (e.g., terminations) are monitored for risky behavior. |
| **Support Compliance**       | Detects activities that could lead to regulatory violations (GDPR, HIPAA).     |

Insider Risk Management shifts your defense **from reactive to proactive**.

### **How Insider Risk Management Works**

IRM operates by **collecting signals** from across your Microsoft environment, such as:

* File downloads
* Email forwarding
* Accessing sensitive SharePoint sites
* Printing confidential documents
* Uploading data to personal cloud storage
* Unusual login behavior

It uses these **signals** combined with **pre-defined policies** to detect risk indicators like:

* Potential data leaks
* Security violations
* Compliance violations

### **Types of Risk Indicators in Purview**

| Risk Indicator              | Description                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Exfiltration**       | Uploading files to external cloud services (e.g., Dropbox, Gmail). |
| **Malicious User Activity** | Deleting large amounts of files, tampering with data.              |
| **HR Indicators**           | Employees on performance plans, leaving the company, layoffs.      |
| **Policy Violations**       | Violations of communication policies (e.g., harassment, threats).  |
| **Security Violations**     | Accessing unauthorized systems, unusual login locations.           |

You can **customize** what signals matter most for your organization.

### **Privacy by Design**

A critical aspect of Insider Risk Management is **user privacy**.

Microsoft Purview applies:

* **Role-based access control** (only authorized users can view cases)
* **Anonymization** (users are shown as User1, User2, etc., until a case is escalated)
* **Audit logs** (every action is logged for transparency)

This ensures IRM can **detect risks** while still **protecting employee privacy**.
