# Introduction

### **What is Microsoft Purview?**

Microsoft Purview is a **comprehensive suite of solutions** that helps organizations manage, govern, protect, and ensure compliance of their data across **Microsoft 365**, **Azure**, **on-premises**, and **multi-cloud environments** (like AWS and GCP).

Think of Microsoft Purview as your **central nervous system for data security and governance**.\
It lets you **discover**, **classify**, **protect**, **monitor**, and **respond** to risks associated with data — no matter where it lives.

> **Important:** Microsoft Purview is not just for Microsoft data. It can govern **non-Microsoft clouds** (AWS S3 buckets, Google Storage) and **on-premises databases** as well.

***

### **Why Was Purview Created?**

Organizations face enormous challenges today:

* Data is spread across multiple clouds, on-premises servers, apps, and devices.
* Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA demand strict data protection.
* Insider threats, accidental data leaks, and regulatory audits are rising.

**Microsoft created Purview** to simplify managing all of this complexity from **one unified platform** — instead of forcing businesses to stitch together multiple disconnected tools.

Originally, Microsoft had **Azure Purview** (focused on data governance) and **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center** (focused on compliance).\
In 2022, they **merged everything under one brand**: **Microsoft Purview**.

Now, **security teams**, **compliance teams**, **risk managers**, and **data owners** can all work together from a **single interface**.
