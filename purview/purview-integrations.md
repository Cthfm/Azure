# Purview Integrations

### **Why Integrate Microsoft Purview with Other Tools?**

**Microsoft Purview** becomes **even more powerful** when you integrate it with:

> **SIEMs, SOAR platforms, security tools, automation workflows, and APIs.**

Integrations allow you to:

* Automate responses to compliance and security events
* Centralize monitoring and alerting
* Enhance incident response
* Connect Purview insights with other Microsoft security products
* Build custom solutions and dashboards

**Key idea:**

> Integration turns Purview into a part of a larger security and compliance **ecosystem**.

### **Key Integrations to Know**

| Tool/Service                                 | Integration Benefit                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)**                | Centralize Purview audit logs and compliance alerts for security monitoring. |
| **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (CASB)** | Monitor risky behavior related to data protection across cloud apps.         |
| **Power Automate (Workflow Automation)**     | Build automatic workflows triggered by Purview alerts or policy violations.  |
| **Microsoft Graph API**                      | Programmatically access Purview data, alerts, and configurations.            |

### **Integration 1: Microsoft Sentinel**

**Microsoft Sentinel** is a **cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** platform.

**How it integrates with Purview:**

* Ingest **Audit logs** from Microsoft Purview.
* Monitor **DLP policy matches** and **insider risk alerts**.
* Create **security analytics rules** to trigger incidents based on Purview events.

**Use Case Example:**

* If a DLP policy detects mass downloads of sensitive data → **Create an incident** in Sentinel for the SOC team to investigate.

**Integration Steps:**

1. In Sentinel, connect **Office 365** and **Microsoft Purview** data connectors.
2. Configure **Analytics Rules** to detect Purview-specific events.
3. Set up **Workbooks** for compliance dashboards.

***

### **Integration 2: Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA)**

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** (formerly Microsoft Cloud App Security) is a **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**.

**How it integrates with Purview:**

* Monitor **external sharing** of sensitive files labeled with Purview Sensitivity Labels.
* Detect **Shadow IT** behavior — e.g., uploading Purview-protected files to unsanctioned apps like Dropbox.
* Create policies to **block risky behavior** automatically.

**Use Case Example:**

* If a user uploads a file labeled "Highly Confidential" to a personal Dropbox account → **MDCA triggers an alert or blocks the upload.**

**Integration Steps:**

1. Configure **Information Protection integration** in MDCA settings.
2. Set up **file policies** that detect Purview Sensitivity Labels.

***

### **Integration 3: Power Automate**

**Power Automate** allows you to create **automated workflows** triggered by events in Purview.

**How it integrates with Purview:**

* Automate responses to DLP alerts, audit events, or insider risk alerts.
* Send notifications, escalate incidents, create tickets, or start remediation automatically.

**Use Case Example:**

* If a DLP policy match occurs → **Automatically send a Teams notification to the Security Team**.

**Sample Flow:**

1. **Trigger**: DLP alert in Purview.
2. **Action**: Create a new ticket in ServiceNow or post a message in a Teams channel.

**Integration Steps:**

1. Use **Power Automate Templates** for Microsoft Purview.
2. Customize triggers and actions based on your organization's needs.

***

### **Integration 4: Microsoft Graph API**

**Microsoft Graph API** allows developers to **programmatically interact** with Microsoft 365 services, including Purview.

**What you can do with Graph API:**

* Query **audit logs** and **compliance alerts**.
* Manage **DLP policies** and **sensitivity labels**.
* Automate **Subject Rights Requests (SRRs)**.
* Build custom reporting dashboards.

**Use Case Example:**

* Build a custom dashboard that shows all DLP violations across SharePoint and Teams in real time.

**Integration Steps:**

1. Register an application in **Azure AD** to get access tokens.
2. Use Graph API endpoints for:
   * `/security/alerts`
   * `/compliance/ediscovery/cases`
   * `/security/subjectRightsRequests`

> **Tip:**\
> Always follow Microsoft’s security best practices when using Graph API, like using least privilege permissions.

### **Hands-On Lab: Create a Power Automate Flow for DLP Alerts**

**Objective:**\
Build an automated workflow to notify a Teams channel when a DLP alert is triggered.

#### Step 1: Create a Power Automate Flow

1. Go to [Power Automate Portal](https://flow.microsoft.com/).
2. Create a **new automated cloud flow**.
3. Set the **trigger**:
   * **When a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alert is triggered**.

#### Step 2: Configure the Action

* Action: **Post a message in a Teams Channel**.
* Message: Include alert details (policy name, user, severity).

#### Step 3: Test It

* Trigger a DLP policy match.
* Verify the alert appears in Teams automatically.

### **Best Practices for Purview Integrations**

| Best Practice                                 | Why It Matters                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Centralize compliance alerts**              | Easier monitoring and faster incident response. |
| **Automate simple response actions**          | Reduces manual workloads.                       |
| **Use least privilege when connecting APIs**  | Minimize security risk.                         |
| **Test integrations in staging environments** | Prevent accidental disruptions.                 |
| **Regularly update connectors and flows**     | Stay compatible with Microsoft changes.         |
