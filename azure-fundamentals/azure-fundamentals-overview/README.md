# Azure Fundamentals Overview

In the context of threat hunting within Azure environments, a solid grasp of Azure fundamentals is essential for effectively detecting, investigating, and mitigating security incidents.&#x20;

This section provides a foundational overview of key Azure concepts tailored for threat hunting professionals, covering critical aspects such as Azure documentation, Azure Entitlement Management (Azure Entitlements), Azure roles, licensing considerations, shared responsibility models, and fundamental Azure services.

**Azure Documentation**: Azure's extensive documentation serves as a vital resource for threat hunters, offering detailed guides, tutorials, and reference materials essential for understanding Azure services and security features.

**Azure Entitlement Management (Azure Entitlements)**: This framework governs access permissions within Azure environments, enabling threat hunters to manage and monitor access controls effectively to prevent unauthorized activities.

**Azure Roles**: Azure's RBAC system allows threat hunters to assign and manage permissions based on specific job functions and responsibilities, ensuring secure access and effective monitoring across Azure resources.

**Azure Licensing Overview**: Understanding Azure licensing helps threat hunters navigate cost implications and compliance requirements associated with Azure services, ensuring alignment with security strategies and budget constraints.

**Azure Hierarchy -** Understand the components of a tenant and how reach resource type interacts with each other within the tenant hierarchy.&#x20;

**Azure Shared Responsibility**: The shared responsibility model outlines the division of security responsibilities between Azure and its customers, guiding threat hunters in implementing appropriate security measures and monitoring practices.

**Fundamental Azure Services**: An overview of core Azure services relevant to threat hunting, including Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel, and others essential for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats.

**Identities:** An overview of the common entity types that you will run into when interacting with Azure resources. The section includes use case examples as well.&#x20;

**Conditional Access Policies:** Foundational to Azure in a world of identities and borderless perimeters. Necessary to utilize to keep authorized users in and unauthorized users out.&#x20;

**Azure Frameworks:** References to the key frameworks such as the "Well Architected Framework" that shows users how to build and deploy resources in Azure appropriately. Cloud Adoption Framework to help organizations that are new to the Azure Cloud. Security Benchmarks to ensure resources are secure and compliant.&#x20;
