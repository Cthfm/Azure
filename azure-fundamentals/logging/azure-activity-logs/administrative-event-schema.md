# Administrative Event Schema

## Overview:&#x20;

This section provides an deeper explanation of the Administrative events as well as the associated schema.&#x20;

### Azure Activity Log: Administrative Events

The Administrative category in the Azure Activity Log records all create, update, delete, and action operations performed through Azure Resource Manager. This includes actions like creating a virtual machine or deleting a network security group. Every operation initiated by a user or application on a resource is logged, capturing both the start and the outcome (success or failure) of the action. Additionally, this category logs any changes made to Azure role-based access control within a subscription.
