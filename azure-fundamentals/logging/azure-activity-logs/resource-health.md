# Resource Health

## Overview:

The following section goes over the Resource Health Category of Azure Activity logs and provides the appropriate schema for these logs.&#x20;

### Resource Health Logs:

The Resource Health category in the Azure Activity Log records events related to the health status of your Azure resources. These events reflect changes in resource health, such as a virtual machine becoming unavailable, and can indicate one of four statuses: Available, Unavailable, Degraded, or Unknown. Resource health events are logged when a resource's health changes significantly, such as moving to or from an unhealthy state, or remaining unhealthy for more than 15 minutes. However, certain transitions, like brief or initial changes to an Unknown state, are not recorded. Additionally, these events can be classified as either Platform Initiated or User Initiated.
