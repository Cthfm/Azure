# Identity Based Logs

## Identity Logs Overview:

Microsoft Azure identifies three different identity-based logs. These include:

* **Audit logs** include the history of every task performed in your tenant.
* **Sign-in logs** capture the sign-in attempts of your users and client applications.
* **Provisioning logs** provide information around users provisioned in your tenant through a third party service.

More details regarding role access and associated schema are provided in corresponding sections.
