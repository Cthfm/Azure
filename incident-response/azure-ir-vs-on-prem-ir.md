# Azure IR vs On-Prem IR

### Overview:

The following provides an overview of Azure specific threats as well as a comparison between Azure and on-premise IR.

### **1. Azure vs. On-Premises**:

* Shared Responsibility Model:
  * Microsoft manages the security of the cloud (infrastructure).
  * Customers manage security in the cloud (applications, data, access).
* Increased complexity due to multi-tenant environments and distributed systems.

### **2. Common Cloud-Specific Threats**:

* Misconfigurations (e.g., public access to storage).
* Identity-based attacks (e.g., stolen Azure AD credentials).
* Lateral movement using compromised Azure resources.
* Attacks exploiting APIs and serverless functions.
