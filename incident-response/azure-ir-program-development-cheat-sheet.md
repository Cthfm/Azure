# Azure IR Program Development Cheat Sheet

## **Overview**

The following is a cheat sheet for an organization attempting to build an IR program within their Azure tenant.&#x20;

### **1. Define the Incident Response Vision**

Align the IR program with business objectives and risk tolerance.

* **Key Questions**:
  1. What are the critical assets and services in Azure that need protection?
  2. What level of risk is acceptable to the organization?
  3. What are the compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001)?
* **Action**:
  * Document the business impact of potential incidents (financial, reputational, operational).
  * Develop an IR mission statement emphasizing rapid recovery and resilience.

### **2. Establish Governance and Ownership**

* **Key Roles and Responsibilities**:
  * **Executive Sponsor**: Ensure funding and alignment with strategic goals.
  * **Incident Response Lead**: Oversee program implementation and incident management.
  * **Azure Security Architect**: Design secure cloud architectures and advise on remediation.
  * **IR Team Members**: Analysts, engineers, and forensic specialists to execute tasks.
* **Policies and Guidelines**:
  * Develop an Incident Response Policy defining:
    * What constitutes an incident.
    * The scope of Azure-specific incidents (e.g., VM compromises, identity breaches).
    * Reporting timelines and escalation protocols.
  * Establish a Cloud Security Governance Framework to oversee cloud-specific risks.

### **3. Build an IR Playbook Framework**

**Playbook Components**:

1. **Incident Types**: Define playbooks for common incidents, such as:
   * Credential compromise.
   * Data exfiltration.
   * DDoS attacks.
   * Malware infections on Azure VMs.
2. **Phases**:
   * **Preparation**: Proactive measures like hardening, monitoring, and training.
   * **Detection and Analysis**: Identifying and understanding incidents.
   * **Containment and Eradication**: Isolating and eliminating threats.
   * **Recovery**: Restoring operations and verifying integrity.
   * **Post-Incident Activities**: Documentation, RCA, and improvements.
3. **Stakeholder Roles**:
   * Include communication templates for executive briefings and compliance reports.

### **4. Prioritize Critical Azure Resources**

**Strategic Asset Identification**:

* Use Azure Resource Graph to inventory assets.
* Prioritize resources based on their criticality:
  * **Tier 1**: Business-critical applications and databases.
  * **Tier 2**: Customer-facing services.
  * **Tier 3**: Development and test environments.

**Resilience Planning**:

* Enforce **disaster recovery (DR)** plans using Azure Backup and Site Recovery.
* Use Azure Availability Zones and Global Load Balancing for fault tolerance.

### **5. Integrate with Risk Management**

**Threat Modeling**:

* Conduct threat modeling for Azure workloads to identify potential attack vectors.
* Use frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK for Cloud to understand tactics and techniques.

**Risk Mitigation**:

* Implement security controls based on identified risks:
  * **Identity**: Enforce Conditional Access policies and MFA.
  * **Network**: Leverage NSGs, Azure Firewall, and Private Endpoints.
  * **Data**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest, and use Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

### **6. Build and Test Operational Readiness**

**Proactive Preparation**:

* Train the IR team on Azure tools, including Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Monitor.
* Simulate incidents using tabletop exercises and red team simulations.

**Exercise Scenarios**:

**Compromised Credentials**:

* Simulate an attacker accessing Azure resources with stolen credentials.
* Test detection, containment, and recovery actions.

**Data Breach**:

* Simulate unauthorized data access via a misconfigured storage account.
* Validate incident reporting workflows.

**KPIs for Readiness**:

* **MTTD**: Mean Time to Detect.
* **MTTR**: Mean Time to Respond.
* **False Positive Rate**: Measure detection accuracy.

### **7. Leverage Azure Native Tools Strategically**

* **Detection and Monitoring**:
  * Centralize logs in Azure Monitor and use Sentinel for SIEM and SOAR capabilities.
  * Integrate threat intelligence feeds with Sentinel for context-aware alerts.
* **Automation**:
  * Build reusable playbooks with Azure Logic Apps for standardized responses.
  * Automate routine tasks with Azure Automation to reduce manual effort.
* **Compliance Alignment:**
  * Use Azure Policy to enforce security baselines.
  * Regularly review compliance insights in Azure Security Center.

### **8. Establish Communication Protocols**

* **Internal Communications**:
  * Develop an escalation matrix for Azure-specific incidents.
  * Use Microsoft Teams for real-time collaboration during incidents.
* **External Communications**:
  * Create communication plans for notifying customers, regulators, and media.
  * Develop pre-approved templates for breach notifications.

### **9. Post-Incident Review and Continuous Improvement**

* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:
  * Conduct a thorough RCA to determine how the incident occurred.
  * Document contributing factors (e.g., human error, misconfiguration).
* **Lessons Learned**:
  * Identify areas for improvement in detection, response, and containment.
  * Update IR playbooks and policies accordingly.
* **Metrics to Track**:
  * Incident trends over time.
  * Time spent in each phase of the IR lifecycle.
  * Cost impact of incidents.

### **10. Focus on Proactive Threat Hunting**

* **Strategic Approach**:
  * Use Azure Sentinel to develop advanced hunting queries.
  * Identify patterns of suspicious behavior (e.g., unusual sign-ins, anomalous network activity).
* **Periodic Audits**:
  * Review Azure resource configurations for misconfigurations.
  * Regularly assess RBAC assignments for overprovisioned permissions.

### **11. Measure Key Success Factors**

1. **Alignment with Business Goals**:
   * Ensure the IR program supports business continuity and resilience.
2. **Proactive Preparation**:
   * Build a culture of readiness through training, simulations, and continuous improvement.
3. **Efficient Tool Integration**:
   * Leverage Azure-native tools strategically to streamline detection and response.
4. **Robust Communication**:
   * Establish clear channels for internal and external stakeholders.
5. **Metrics-Driven Improvement**:
   * Use KPIs to evaluate and enhance IR effectiveness over time.
