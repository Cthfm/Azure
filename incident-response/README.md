# Incident Response

#### **What is Incident Response (IR)?**

**Definition**:

* Incident Response is the structured approach to managing and mitigating security breaches or cyberattacks.
* It involves preparing for, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents.
* **Importance**:
  1. Minimize damage to assets and operations.
  2. Preserve the integrity of the business.
  3. Ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks.
* **Core IR Lifecycle**:
  * **Preparation**: Develop IR policies, train teams, and configure tools.
  * **Detection and Analysis**: Identify security events and understand their scope and impact.
  * **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: Take immediate actions to stop and fix the issue.
  * **Post-Incident Activities**: Document lessons learned and improve security posture.

#### **Section 1.2: Unique Challenges of Incident Response in the Cloud**

* **Azure vs. On-Premises**:
  * Shared Responsibility Model:
    * Microsoft manages the security of the cloud (infrastructure).
    * Customers manage security in the cloud (applications, data, access).
  * Increased complexity due to multi-tenant environments and distributed systems.
* **Common Cloud-Specific Threats**:
  1. Misconfigurations (e.g., public access to storage).
  2. Identity-based attacks (e.g., stolen Azure AD credentials).
  3. Lateral movement using compromised Azure resources.
  4. Attacks exploiting APIs and serverless functions.

***

#### **Section 1.3: Azure’s Incident Response Ecosystem**

Azure provides native tools and services to enhance each phase of the IR lifecycle.

**1. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Azure Monitor**:
  * Collect and analyze metrics and logs from Azure resources.
* **Azure Security Center**:
  * Monitor Azure resources for vulnerabilities and threats.
  * Provides Secure Score to measure security posture.
* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**:
  * Integrated protection for hybrid environments.

**2. Response and Investigation:**

* **Azure Sentinel**:
  * Cloud-native SIEM for detecting and responding to threats.
* **Log Analytics**:
  * Query and analyze logs for deeper insights into incidents.
* **Microsoft Graph Security API**:
  * Centralized API for integrating threat intelligence and alerts.

**3. Automation and Orchestration:**

* **Azure Automation**:
  * Automate response tasks like disabling accounts or isolating resources.
* **Logic Apps**:
  * Orchestrate workflows for incident response playbooks.
* **Azure Functions**:
  * Trigger automated responses to specific events.

**4. Forensics and Analysis:**

* **Azure Backup**:
  * Use snapshots for forensic analysis and recovery.
* **Azure Resource Graph**:
  * Query and visualize resources to understand attack vectors.

***

#### **Section 1.4: Key IR Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Incident Response Team (IRT)**:
  * Roles:
    * **Incident Commander**: Leads and coordinates the response.
    * **Security Analyst**: Investigates and analyzes the incident.
    * **Cloud Architect**: Understands Azure infrastructure and assists in containment.
    * **Forensic Specialist**: Analyzes logs and evidence.
  * Communication:
    * Use tools like Microsoft Teams for centralized communication during incidents.

***

#### **Section 1.5: Overview of IR Policies and Governance**

* **Developing an IR Policy**:
  1. Define roles and responsibilities.
  2. Establish clear escalation procedures.
  3. Outline incident severity levels and associated responses.
  4. Integrate compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Key Governance Tools**:
  * Azure Policy:
    * Enforce security configurations across Azure resources.
  * Azure Blueprints:
    * Automate the deployment of pre-configured environments.
  * Azure Active Directory (AAD):
    * Implement Conditional Access and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

#### **Section 1.6: Hands-On Lab – Setting Up a Basic IR Framework**

**Scenario:**

You are tasked with preparing your Azure environment for effective incident response.

**Steps:**

1. **Enable Azure Security Center**:
   * Go to the Azure Portal.
   * Navigate to "Security Center" and enable it for your subscription.
   * Configure Secure Score recommendations.
2. **Set Up Azure Monitor**:
   * Create a Log Analytics Workspace.
   * Link Azure resources (e.g., VMs, storage accounts) to the workspace.
3. **Deploy Azure Sentinel**:
   * Navigate to "Azure Sentinel."
   * Connect data sources (e.g., Azure AD, Office 365, Firewalls).
   * Configure a basic analytic rule to detect failed login attempts.
4. **Create an Azure Automation Account**:
   * Use it for automated incident response tasks (e.g., disabling accounts).
5. **Define an IR Playbook**:
   * Document a step-by-step plan for responding to compromised credentials.
