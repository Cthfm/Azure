# Incident Response

### **What is Incident Response (IR)?**

Incident Response is the structured approach to managing and mitigating security breaches or cyberattacks. It involves preparing for, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents.

### **Why is it important?**&#x20;

1. Minimize damage to assets and operations.
2. Preserve the integrity of the business.
3. Ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks.

### **Core IR Lifecycle**:

* **Preparation**: Develop IR policies, train teams, and configure tools.
* **Detection and Analysis**: Identify security events and understand their scope and impact.
* **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: Take immediate actions to stop and fix the issue.
* **Post-Incident Activities**: Document lessons learned and improve security posture.

### **Unique Challenges of Incident Response in the Cloud**

1.  **Cloud Specific Challenges**

    1. Shared Responsibility Model:
    2. Microsoft manages the security of the cloud (infrastructure).
    3. Customers manage security in the cloud (applications, data, access).
    4. Increased complexity due to multi-tenant environments and distributed systems.


2. **Common Cloud-Specific Threats**
   1. Misconfigurations (e.g., public access to storage).
   2. Identity-based attacks (e.g., stolen Azure AD credentials).
   3. Lateral movement using compromised Azure resources.
   4. Attacks exploiting APIs and serverless functions.

### **Azureâ€™s Incident Response Ecosystem**

Azure provides native tools and services to enhance each phase of the IR lifecycle.

**1. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Azure Monitor**:
  * Collect and analyze metrics and logs from Azure resources.
* **Azure Security Center**:
  * Monitor Azure resources for vulnerabilities and threats.
  * Provides Secure Score to measure security posture.
* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**:
  * Integrated protection for hybrid environments.

**2. Response and Investigation:**

* **Azure Sentinel**:
  * Cloud-native SIEM for detecting and responding to threats.
* **Log Analytics**:
  * Query and analyze logs for deeper insights into incidents.
* **Microsoft Graph Security API**:
  * Centralized API for integrating threat intelligence and alerts.

**3. Automation and Orchestration:**

* **Azure Automation**:
  * Automate response tasks like disabling accounts or isolating resources.
* **Logic Apps**:
  * Orchestrate workflows for incident response playbooks.
* **Azure Functions**:
  * Trigger automated responses to specific events.

**4. Forensics and Analysis:**

* **Azure Backup**:
  * Use snapshots for forensic analysis and recovery.
* **Azure Resource Graph**:
  * Query and visualize resources to understand attack vectors.
