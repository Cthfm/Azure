# Handling Large Workflows with Stateful Logic Apps

When building complex threat-hunting or incident response workflows, you may encounter scenarios where the workflow needs to run for an extended period, maintain state between actions, or process large amounts of data. Azure Logic Apps offers stateful workflows that are designed to manage such scenarios efficiently.

## 1. Overview of Stateful vs. Stateless Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps can be created in two modes: **Stateful** and **Stateless**.

* **Stateless Logic Apps**: Execute faster, but they don't preserve the state between actions. They are suited for real-time and short-running processes, such as simple alerts or small workflows that need quick execution.
* **Stateful Logic Apps**: Keep track of state across different steps in the workflow and are ideal for complex, long-running workflows. They store the history of each step, making it easier to manage errors, retries, and decision-making over extended periods.

### **Use Cases for Stateful Logic Apps in Threat Hunting:**

* Handling long-running processes, such as waiting for external systems to respond or awaiting human intervention.
* Complex workflows involving multiple systems that need to maintain context and track intermediate results.
* Large-scale threat-hunting queries that gather and process data over extended periods, such as correlating logs from multiple sources or performing daily batch processing of incidents.

## 2. When to Use Stateful Workflows

Stateful Logic Apps are especially useful in scenarios where the workflow spans multiple steps or external systems, or when the workflow requires manual intervention at certain points.

### **Example Use Cases:**

* **Waiting for Incident Resolution**: You may want to trigger a workflow to handle a security incident but keep the workflow running until the incident is marked as resolved in your incident management system.
* **Handling Asynchronous API Calls**: When interacting with APIs that may take time to respond, a stateful Logic App can maintain the workflow until a response is received.
* **Automating Large-Scale Threat Correlation**: When correlating security logs from multiple sources, you may need to maintain state across different queries and handle large datasets without losing context.

## 3. Creating a Stateful Logic App

When creating a new Logic App in Azure, you can choose between a **Consumption** (Stateless) Logic App or a **Standard** (Stateful) Logic App. The **Standard** Logic Apps have built-in support for stateful workflows.

### **Steps to Create a Stateful Logic App:**

1. **Create a New Standard Logic App**:
   * In the Azure Portal, select **Create a Resource**.
   * Search for **Logic App (Standard)**.
   * Choose the region, name, and resource group for your Logic App.
   * Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.
2. **Design the Stateful Workflow**:
   * Once the Logic App is created, open the **Logic Apps Designer** and start building the workflow.
   * Add actions like **waiting for incident resolution**, **calling APIs**, or **gathering data** from external sources.
3. **Use Delay Actions**:
   * If your workflow involves long-running tasks (e.g., waiting for an incident to be closed or waiting for a manual review), you can use the **Delay** action to pause the workflow for a specific period before resuming.
   * Example: Add a **Delay** action to check every hour if an incident has been resolved.
4. **Use Parallel Branching**:
   * Stateful Logic Apps support parallel branching, which allows you to run different parts of the workflow simultaneously.
   * This is useful for performing multiple threat-hunting tasks in parallel, such as querying multiple log sources for suspicious activity.

## 4. Handling Long-Running Processes with Stateful Workflows

One of the key advantages of stateful workflows is their ability to handle long-running processes while maintaining the state of the workflow.

### **Example: Automating Incident Follow-up and Remediation**

Consider a scenario where you need to automatically follow up on a security incident reported in your incident management system, but the incident might take several hours or even days to resolve. You want your Logic App to continue running, checking the incident status at regular intervals until it is closed.

**Steps:**

1. **Trigger**: Start the Logic App when an incident is created in the incident management system (e.g., ServiceNow or Jira).
2. **Delay Action**: Add a **Delay** action to wait for a specified period (e.g., 1 hour).
3. **Query Incident Status**: After the delay, query the incident management system to check if the incident has been resolved.
4. **Loop Until Resolution**: Use an **Until** control to keep repeating the delay and query actions until the incident is marked as resolved.
5. **Take Final Action**: Once the incident is resolved, execute the next steps, such as closing the incident in the system or notifying the security team.

This type of workflow could run for hours or days, and the state of the workflow (i.e., the fact that it's waiting for resolution) is preserved across all these steps.

## 5. Error Handling in Stateful Logic Apps

Stateful Logic Apps offer advanced error-handling capabilities, allowing you to manage failures and retries across different steps in the workflow.

### **Example: Handling API Errors in Long-Running Workflows**

In long-running workflows, itâ€™s common to encounter transient issues, such as API timeouts or network failures. Stateful Logic Apps allow you to handle these errors effectively by storing the state of the workflow and providing options to retry actions.

**Steps for Handling API Errors**:

1. **Add an HTTP Action**: Make an API call to an external threat intelligence platform or security tool.
2. **Configure Error Handling**:
   * Click on the ellipsis (three dots) of the HTTP action.
   * Select **Configure run after**, and define what should happen if the action fails (e.g., retry, log error, or notify).
3. **Use Retry Policies**: Define retry policies for actions that might fail. For example, if the API request fails due to a timeout, configure the Logic App to retry the request a few times before marking it as failed.

## 6. Managing Large-Scale Data Processing

Stateful Logic Apps are ideal for processing large volumes of data, such as when you need to ingest and correlate logs from multiple sources or scan through large datasets during threat-hunting operations.

### **Example: Correlating Logs from Multiple Sources**

You can build a workflow that queries multiple log sources, such as Azure Monitor, Office 365 logs, and third-party SIEMs, and then correlates the data to identify suspicious patterns.

**Steps:**

1. **Trigger**: Set the workflow to trigger at regular intervals (e.g., daily) or in response to an event (e.g., when a specific threat indicator is found).
2. **Query Multiple Log Sources**:
   * Use built-in connectors or HTTP actions to query logs from different sources.
3. **Correlate Data**:
   * Store the results of each query in variables and correlate the data to detect suspicious activity.
4. **Store Results**: Save the correlated results in a database or alert the security team for further investigation.

## 7. Best Practices for Stateful Logic Apps

* **Use Delay Actions and Loops Carefully**: When building long-running workflows, be mindful of how often actions are triggered. Use delay actions to avoid overwhelming systems with too many requests.
* **Enable Error Handling and Retries**: Always configure error-handling mechanisms and retries to ensure that the workflow can recover from transient errors.
* **Monitor Workflow Performance**: Stateful Logic Apps store the history of each step, allowing you to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues more easily. Use Azure Monitor to track workflow performance and ensure workflows run as expected.
* **Optimize for Cost**: While stateful Logic Apps provide powerful capabilities, they can incur higher costs due to their storage of state. Be mindful of your use of storage and compute resources.
