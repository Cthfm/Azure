# Detection Lab Introduction

This is where you build real skills that are hands on and from scratch.

In the next few sections, you’ll create a fully functional cloud lab environment and create a real-world security detection within Azure.&#x20;

We’re starting at square one: setting up a secure Azure account with multi-factor authentication so your foundation is rock solid.

Then we’ll install the essential tools every cloud defender needs: Azure CLI, PowerShell, GitHub, and VS Code. You’ll spin up a GitHub project using Terraform to deploy infrastructure directly into Azure, configure logging that actually captures what matters, and finally—build and test your own custom detection rule end-to-end.

By the time you’re done, you'll have some hands-on experience with deploying IAC, setting up resources, logging and much more. &#x20;
