# Security API References

## Overview

The following are references to the Security API within Microsoft Graph and how it works.

### How it Works

The Microsoft Graph Security API provides a unified interface to connect various Microsoft security products, services, and partners. By acting as a central broker, it streamlines security operations and enhances capabilities for threat protection, detection, and response. When an application sends a request, the API federates it across all connected security providers, aggregates the results, and returns the data in a standardized schema. This approach simplifies the integration and management of multiple security tools through a single, programmatic interface.&#x20;
